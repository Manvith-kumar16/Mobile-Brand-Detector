Mobile Detector Frontend
This is the web interface for the Mobile Detector project. It's a single HTML file that allows users to upload an image and interact with the backend API to get predictions.

Running the Frontend
To view the web page, simply open index.html in your web browser. There is no need for a web server, as all the code is self-contained within the file.

Interacting with the Backend
This frontend makes an API call to http://localhost:5000/predict. For it to work, you must have the backend server running on your machine.
